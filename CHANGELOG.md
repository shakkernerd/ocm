# Changelog

All notable changes to OCM are documented here.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.27 - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Prevent `runtime build-local` from reconciling or replacing an OpenClaw checkout's dependencies while running its package build.
- Reject an already-running shared OCM daemon when its service definition belongs to another `OCM_HOME`, and remove the shared service binding after the last running environment stops or is uninstalled.
- Reuse an identical healthy official runtime when concurrent installers publish it first instead of failing the waiting command.

## 0.2.26 - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Match environment-owned processes by path components so destroy never targets sibling-prefix directories.
- Replace copied OpenClaw config symlinks with environment-owned files without rewriting external targets.
- Serialize environment cleanup with other mutations so repairs cannot save stale bindings or race destroy.
- Add atomic state-token guards for automation that previews and destroys environments.
- Keep automatically assigned gateway ports stable across create, show, list, and status output.
- Give cloned and imported environments independent service state and collision-free gateway ports.
- Serialize environment registry transactions so concurrent lifecycle commands preserve every entry and allocate distinct ports.
- Preserve environment roots and recovery snapshots when dev worktree cleanup fails during destroy.
- Keep auto-assigned ports stable without overriding a later gateway port written by OpenClaw configuration.
- Reject non-UTF-8 process input cleanly, require version flags to stand alone, and terminate quietly when a pipeline closes its output.
- Prevent Fish activation injection through crafted paths and clear stale OpenClaw controls when switching environments.
- Keep tables within narrow terminal widths by truncating headers or falling back to compact rows.
- Verify self-update release digests and staged binary versions before replacement, compare releases with SemVer precedence, clean temporary artifacts on failure, and reject Linux ARM64 until release assets are published.
- Reject launcher deletion while environments still depend on it, and route shell-expanding launcher recipes through a shell instead of lossy direct execution.
- Accept the standard human-output flags for `runtime releases` and document `runtime build-local` in the command map.
- Keep plain-home migration path rewrites scoped to the imported OpenClaw state and reject overlapping source and target roots before mutation.
- Fail migration planning on corrupt environment registries and only auto-bind executable OpenClaw commands from `PATH`.
- Report launcher and environment rollback failures alongside the original migration error instead of hiding partial cleanup.
- Make release preparation rollback-safe, verify signed annotated tags on every resume path, and publish branch and tag refs atomically.
- Build locked release artifacts only from a GitHub-verified tag matching the package version, require the complete supported target matrix before publication, publish a versioned checksum-verifying installer, pin CI actions, and test the declared Rust 1.88 minimum.
- Preserve uncommitted dev worktrees and reject unrelated checkout collisions by requiring exact Git worktree registration before reuse or removal.
- Make single and merged log following rotation-safe and byte-safe, preserving split or invalid UTF-8, multiline record ordering, and boundaries around unterminated records.
- Prevent overlapping source watches, remove the unleased override mutation path, reclaim stale watch locks, preserve terminal job control, handle termination signals, and restore background-service policy when takeover cannot stop or exits with an error.
- Verify managed Node.js archives against pinned release checksums and serialize bootstrap so concurrent processes cannot delete a valid toolchain.
- Preserve working runtimes until replacement artifacts, dependencies, and metadata are ready; require release integrity and reject unsafe artifact names.
- Write private service definitions, preserve existing service-directory modes, escape systemd specifiers, reject directive injection, and fail closed on unknown launchd users or cross-store service ownership.
- Serialize supervisor restart requests, restore service policy after failed reconciliation, preserve raw warnings, and fail upgrades when a gateway restart cannot be observed.
- Preserve every recognized npm release channel when multiple dist-tags point to the same OpenClaw version.
- Keep exact-version release guidance pinned to the selected version instead of a mutable channel.
- Make release-validation runs package-shaped, commit-pinned, concurrency-safe, credential-aware, and explicit about session-preserving fixtures and owned cleanup.
